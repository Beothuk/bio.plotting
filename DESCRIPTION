Description: This package facilitates the creation of basemaps in any projection.  Areas of importance (e.g. strata, fishing areas) can 
  easily be added.  Dataframes can also be overlain easily, displayed either generically, or as a number of discrete classes depending on the 
  value of a particular field.
